# Water Masses of the Arctic (WMA) Classification Tool

This repository contains the scripts required to generate the *Water Masses of the Arctic (WMA)* dataset: 
- Processing and compiling of Arctic observations directly from publicly available online sources
- Estimating relative fractions of Arctic water masses from observations via traditional water mass classification with a machine learning extension
- Extras: application of WMA tool to the Arctic Subpolar gyre sTate Estimate (Nguyen et al., 2021) and alternative objective clustering of Arctic observations
